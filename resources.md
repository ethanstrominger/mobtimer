## React and React Hook Tutorials

**Background**
There are two types of components that can be used for a React Application: class or function.
MobTimer uses hooks, which is more current and considered to be better.

reactJS.org has an excellent tutorial that uses class, but most of it is also relevant, so it is listed below with the relevant sections.

- [reactjs.org Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) - read section 1 through 4. Links to these sections are listed below or you can click next as you complete each section.
