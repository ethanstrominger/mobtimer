## Coding Challenges

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) is a website with coding questions (challenges) categoried by difficulty, tag, and other criteria, as well as other information specifically useful for job searchers.
  - **Difficulty:** On job interviews, you will typically get problems of "medium" difficulty and have between an hour and an hour and a half.  The difficulty rating is not perfect - some Hard questions are Medium, some Easy questions are Medium, and vice versa.
  - **Tags:** The tags let you practice specific topics such as linked lists, dynamic programming, recursion, and more.
  - **Solution Performance:** When you complete a challenge, LeetCode will tell you how your solution compares to other solutions.  If you are in the bottom 50%, try again!  You can also check how you did when returning to the website if you click on the problem you solved, click on Submissions, and then click on "Accepted".
  - **Getting Help:** There is a discussion tab where possible solutions are discussed.

- [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com) - popular tool used by employees for assessing job candidates.  LeetCode has more resources, categorization, and functionality. However, if you are job seeking, you may want to become familiar with HackerRank.

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is great fun for the mathematically-minded. Over 650 problems which ramp up rather quickly in difficulty. If you've got a strong mathematical background you'll have a real advantage here. If not, you might well acquire one.

 - [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a Christmas-themed problem set that has offered 25 new programming challenges every December since 2015. Each set is a collection of well-made problems that challenge your ability to reason algorithmically. Problems range from moderate to difficult.

- [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is a bit of a hodge-podge, offering a well-curated collection of problems introducing concepts in bioinformatics, a small set of introductory Software Crafters problems, and a collection of classical algorithms to implement.
