**Practices to Focus On**:
- **Strict navigator style**
- **If confused as driver, ask questions rather than suggesting alternatives**

- **Full TDD w/explicit "Refactor" convo & impl. every time, including:**
  - No `any` types
  - Refactor redundant code
  - Encapsulate & information hide
  - Consistent level of abstraction
  - Consistent names & naming conventions (e.g., underscore for private fields, capitalization, etc.)
  - Avoid tech debt
  - ... (add more as we go)
- **Retro at end of each 2-hour session (so can impl. immediately rather than wait a week)**
- **Phrases**:
  - "Got it" (ELMO) [Joel-not sure if this is working that well... 6/29/22]
  - "Hold on" (Navigator wants floor)
- **Remember to give credit to co-author**:

**Practices to Try**:
- **5/25/2022:** Each person gets approx. 1 hour to be the leader on what we work on

**Established Practices**:
- **Terminology**
    - VSCode Bar
    - Inline icons
    - Code Tab
    - Browser Tab
    - Left code pane, right code pane
- **Always verbalize intent**: Navigator verbalize your intent (why) before directing, when coding or exploring code
- **Avoid rabbit holes**: When exploring and mob timer elapses, reevaluate if going down a productive path
- **Scribe**: If desired, in retro, request that talker and scribe should be separate people
- **Commit frequently on feature branch**
