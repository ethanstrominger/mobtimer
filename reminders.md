**Practices to Try**:
- **5/25/2022:** Each person gets approx. 1 hour to be the leader on what we work on
---

**Practices to Focus On**:
- **Phrases**:
  - "Got it" (ELMO)
  - "Hold on" (Navigator wants floor)
- **Remember to give credit to co-author**.  Example: `Co-authored-by: Ethan Strominger <ethanstrominger2@gmail.com>` (email is the github user email)

---

**Established Practices**:
- **Terminology**
    - VSCode Bar
    - Inline icons
    - Code Tab
    - Browser Tab
    - Left code pane, right code pane
- **Always verbalize intent**: Navigator verbalize your intent (why) before directing, when coding or exploring code
- **Avoid rabbit holes**: When exploring and mob timer elapses, reevaluate if going down a productive path
- **Scribe**: If desired, in retro, request that talker and scribe should be separate people
- **Commit frequently on feature branch**
