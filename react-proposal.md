- Start with React todo example for managing todos (common example used for React). Todo data is fetched and stored to local storage.
  - Find code
  - Study code
  - Create repo
- Create a button that sends a join mob and a separate for start timer.
- Change fetch to treat each received message as a todo, so maintain a list of messages. Any time a message is received, ToDo data gets populated with the message.  This is just for POC, might not need screen for long term.
- Add a compponent for displaying mob state.
