- Start with React todo example for managing todos. Todo data is fetched and stored to local storage.
- Store in separate repository - makes deployment easier.
- Create a button that sends a join mob and a separate for start timer.
- Change fetch to treat each message as a todo, so maintain a list of messages. Any time a message is received, it gets populated.
- Add a compponent for displaying mob state.
